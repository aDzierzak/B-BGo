/** Steps for mySQL/Java usage: <p>
*  <ol>
*  	<li> Download mySQL and install
*  	<li> Configure a mysql server instance as part of install process
* 		<li> Download and install the mySQL gui tools
* 		<li> In the mysql administrator GUI tool you can create a database (a catalogue)
* 		<li> Generate the appropriate tables using mySQL administrator or straight SQL queries
* 		<li> Download the JDBC driver for mySQL (Connector/J) and extract the archive
* 		<li> Inside that archive there is a jar file like mysql-connector-java-version-bin.jar.
* 			 Add this to the eclipse build path by right clicking on your project and going to
* 			 "build path" and then to "add external archive".
* 		<li> If you are using a standard text editor you will have to add its location to the classpath
* 		<li> Now you can use the JDBC API calls as illustrated below.
* </ol><p>
* 
*	The sqlengine class is a class that uses Connector/J classes to simplify database
*	access and manipulation by using only a subset of the functionality of the sql
*	classes for common tasks that are available through easy to use methods. <p>
